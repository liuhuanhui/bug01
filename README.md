# element-ui + nuxt + nuxt-i18n
## This.$message.error('wrong, this is an error message'); after calling the popup, I found that the attributes of the html tag (such as lang="en-US") were deleted?



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
